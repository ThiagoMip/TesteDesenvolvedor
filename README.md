<h3 align="center">Test for Developer</h3>

##About:
This repository was created for a vacancy intended for developers, the use of any language was allowed, so I decided to use Python to carry out all the exercises.

##Starting:

###Compiler:
I used the online compiler from OnlineGDB, but you can use whichever compiler you prefer, the file is already in .py format, so you just need to import the file into your compiler.

##Tools used:
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler)
* [Opera Browser](https://www.opera.com/pt-br/gx)
